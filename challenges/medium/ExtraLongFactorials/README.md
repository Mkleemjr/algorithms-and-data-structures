# Extra Long Factorials

The factorial of the integer `n`, written `n!`, is defined as:

    n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1

Calculate and print the factorial of a given integer.

For example, if `n = 30`, we calculate `30 x 29 x 28 x ... 3 x 2 x 1`  and get `265252859812191058636308480000000`.
