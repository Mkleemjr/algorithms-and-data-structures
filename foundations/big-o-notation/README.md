# Big O Notation

It's useful to have an objective way to compare the performance of an algorithm. After a first-pass solution you'll be looking for improvements. To understand when one algorithm is better than another you'll want to use Big O Notation.

Big O Notation is a measure of the time and space complexity of an algorithm.

## Big O Classifications

    Constant.......O(1)
    Logarithmic....O(log n)
    Linear.........O(n)
    Linearithmic...O(n log n)
    Polynomial.....O(n ^ c)
    Exponential....O(c ^ n)
    Factorial......O(n!)
