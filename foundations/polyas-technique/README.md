# Pólya's Problem Solving Technique

    ”There is no coming to consciousness without pain.” – Carl Jung

    ”There are no gains without pains.” – Benjamin Franklin

    ”Pain + Reflection = Progress” – Ray Dalio

This document is by and for Software Engineers. But the skill of solving problems in a systematic way is not specific to any single profession. To go even further, the framework presented is useful to life outside of work.

The goal of this document is to teach a method for problem solving. More important than knowing any single programming language or framework is the ability to solve problems. Such a method must be generalized enough to be broadly applicable.

The method presented here was created by Hungarian mathematician George Pólya. His work, aimed at teaching mathematics, became successful far outside that domain. His book "How To Solve It" has sold over a million copies and has been translated into 17 languages.
