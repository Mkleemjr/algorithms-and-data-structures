# Pólya's Problem Solving Technique

A fundamental skill of a Software Engineer is the ability to solve problems. This skill is more important than what programming languages or frameworks you use. Those things are always changing. However there will always be complex problems people will pay good money to have solved.

Google Trends can report a declining interest in "problems", but look around you and observe for yourself. Is everything a paradise of perfection? No, probably we could agree there is some room for improvement. Here are some quotes about the struggles of daily life:

    ”There is no coming to consciousness without pain.” – Carl Jung

    ”There are no gains without pains.” – Benjamin Franklin

    ”Pain + Reflection = Progress” – Ray Dalio

With the assumption that problems will always exist, how do we move forward? We could try to solve the problem of solving problems. Such a solution must generalize enough to be broadly applicable. One such framework that has become popular is the Polya's Problem Solving Techniques.

I'd guess every reader here has been solving problems long before they ever heard of George Pólya or his techniques. So why bother learning this stuff if it's common sense? That's a pragmatic question worth exploring.

You may already have a robust framework for solving problems, in which case move along to greener pastures. For everyone else, consider the value of a formal process to solving problems. First, you can go into any problem with some confidence knowing you have a plan.

Isn't this stuff common sense? Yes it is and you may already have an adequate framework for solving problems. If you're reading this and had never heard of Pólya's or his techniques that you've been solving problems every day. The value in learning this technique is to formalize on a specific method.
The dangers of not having a structured way of doing things can result in blurring activities together or skipping some entirely. This often results in feelings of hopelessness or existential dread.

1. First, you have to **understand the problem**.
2. After understanding, **make a plan**.
3. **Implement the plan**.
4. **Look back** on your work. How could it be better?
