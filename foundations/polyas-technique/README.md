# Pólya's Problem Solving Technique

    ”There is no coming to consciousness without pain.” – Carl Jung

    ”There are no gains without pains.” – Benjamin Franklin

    ”Pain + Reflection = Progress” – Ray Dalio

This document is by and for Software Engineers. But the skill of solving problems in a systematic way is not specific to any single profession. To go even further, the framework presented is useful to life outside of work.

The goal of this document is to teach a method for problem solving. More important than knowing any single programming language or framework is the ability to solve problems. Such a method must be generalized enough to be broadly applicable.

The method presented here was created by Hungarian mathematician George Pólya. His work, aimed at teaching mathematics, became successful far outside that domain. His book "How To Solve It" has sold over a million copies and has been translated into 17 languages.

## The Four Step Process

1. First, you have to **understand the problem**.
2. After understanding, **make a plan**.
3. **Implement the plan**.
4. **Look back** on your work. How could it be better?

That's the entire process. You may be thinking, "how boring!". I thought that myself at first. But consider the alternative. What would you have thought if I presented a 20 step process with many decision flows? Trust in the boringly simple long enough and you may see it's beauty.

Some of the dangers of not having a formal process include: doing things out of order, combining steps, and skipping steps. Those mistakes often come with feelings of frustration and hopelessness. Solving problems is difficult, so use any tools you need to make it easier.

Creativity is still required. The process discussed is high level enough to offer structure and room for creativity. It's generalized to be applicable to a broad set of problems. Each unique problem is going to need you to be creative.
